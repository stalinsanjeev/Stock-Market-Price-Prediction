Prediction of Apple Stock Prices Using LSTM model

In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The project focuses on the use of LSTM based Machine learning to predict stock values. Factors considered are open, close, low, high and volume.

A correct prediction of stocks can lead to huge profits for the seller and the broker. Frequently, it is brought out that prediction is chaotic rather than random, which means it can be predicted by carefully analyzing the history of respective stock market. Machine learning is an efficient way to represent such processes. It predicts a market value close to the tangible value, thereby increasing the accuracy. This project uses machine learning for stock prediction because of its efficient and accurate measurements
